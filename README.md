<h1>Abstract</h1>
The Leaf Disease Detection and Cure project utilizes image processing techniques 
on MATLAB to develop an efficient and user-friendly solution for early detection 
and management of leaf diseases in plants. Using image processing algorithms like 
segmentation, feature extraction, and classification, the project aims to overcome 
the limitations of manual detection methods. 
The MATLAB programming stage gives the vital devices and libraries for 
executing these calculations really. A user-friendly interface for uploading leaf 
images and receiving prompt disease diagnoses and treatment recommendations is 
included in the proposed solution. 
Early disease detection, crop loss reduction, and sustainable farming practices will 
all be made possible by this project's successful implementation. The project has 
the potential to change the way diseases are tracked and improve crop health, yield, 
and sustainability, thereby ensuring food security and long-term viability in 
agriculture.
